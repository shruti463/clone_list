# clone_list
PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Craigslist is an eCommerce website much like Amazon, and Flipkart where the user can sell or buy anything.
The only difference is that it has a poor user interface. The main disadvantage is that it is extremely difficult and time-consuming to search for anything on the website much less interact with it. As a developer, it might be easy for me to navigate my way through the site but a person who isn't aware of the working might find the task tiring. Thus avoid visiting the site altogether. This results in reduced traffic on site and decreases the monetary advantages. This further affects the user who wants to sell their product on craigslist. To tackle this problem is the objective of “CLONELIST”.

Description of the project:
My project is a website which scrapes craigslist to project queries in an efficient and easy-to-understand manner.
 It is a web scraping project that provides a better frontend to craigslist and filter functionality for queries. 
The framework used in this project is Django which is a python framework that supports web development for dynamic websites. 
For frontend, Materialize UI and HTML and CSS are used. 
Materialize is a modern responsive CSS framework based on Material Design by Google
